\begin{frame}{Why collaborative learning is important?}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item<1->  Collaboration is one of the \textcolor{blue}{four-essential skills} in 21st century skills
        \item<1->  The advancement of technology and rapidly changing environment require 
        collaborative works of multidisciplinary experts to solve complex problems effectively
        \item<2->  \textcolor{purple}{However}, collaboration \textcolor{blue}{does not merely happen} just because individuals are co-present 
        \item<2->  It is indeed necessary to practice collaboration in the classroom
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Designing learning activities to encourage collaboration}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item<1-> Students' \textcolor{blue}{interactions} play a fundamental role in collaborative learning 
        \cite{Baines2009ImprovingStudy,Webb2009TheClassroom}
        \item<1-> Various instructional strategies are employed to encourage learners to collaborate 
        (i.e. scripts, scenarios, representational tools).
        \item<2> An external representation tool (e.g. concept map) \textcolor{blue}{assists the learner} in articulating and \textcolor{blue}{maintaining shared focus} during discourse \cite{Fischer2002FosteringTools,Suthers2006TechnologyCSCL,vanBoxtel2002CollaborativeDiscourse}.
        %\item<2-> \textcolor{purple}{During collaboration individual learners need to make a continuous effort 
        %to construct and maintain group-shared knowledge \cite{Roschelle1995TheSolving}}. 
        %\item<2-> They may have forgotten prior discussion or feeling difficult to remember 
        %what they have discussed or co-constructed \cite{Jeong2016SevenHelp}.

        \item<2-3> However, conflicting evidence has also been found, indicating that students spend a \textcolor{purple}{considerable amount of time} focusing on task collaboration, procedure and team coordination, \underline{rather than} on \textcolor{purple}{discussions about the concepts or relationships involved \cite{chiu2003exploring}}. 
        
        \item<3> Others have also found that students encountered difficulties in \textcolor{purple}{sharing developed ideas and integrating} them into public knowledge \cite{Gracia-Moreno2017CollaborativeWorkspaces,vanBoxtel2000CollaborativeKnowledge} $\longrightarrow$ some \textcolor{purple}{inaccurate ideas are never challenged} and can become ingrained \cite{roth1992social}.

\subsection{Challenges}

\begin{frame}{Initial researches on RKB}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item <1-3> Initial studies showed that the RKB approach \textcolor{blue}{promoted productive
        discussion} between partners (more exploratory talk)
        \cite{Wunnasri2018ReciprocalUnderstanding}. 
        \item <2-3>The RKB map also \textcolor{blue}{encouraged the pair of partners to understand each other} based on the similarity of the individual post-collaboration map
        \cite{Wunnasri2018ReciprocalCollaboration}. 
        \item <3-> $\longrightarrow$ the RKB can be used to \textcolor{teal}{share understanding as preparation for
        collaboration}. 
        \item <4->However, \textcolor{purple}{they have not evaluated the effect of applying
        this approach to build collaborative products}, so far. 
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Remaining problems}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item <1>\textcolor{blue}{Collaborative product evaluation\\} 
        {\small \textcolor{purple}{After following RKB activities, 
        whether or not students are able to achieve high-quality group solutions?}}
        
        \item <2>\textcolor{blue}{Exploring students' perceptions toward the activity\\} 
        {\small \textcolor{purple}{How is the perceptions of the students while following the learning activities?} An evaluation regarding students' acceptance is as important as the learning product itself.}
        \end{enumerate}
  \end{frame}    
\begin{frame}{Remaining problems (cont'd)}
    \begin{enumerate}\setcounter{enumi}{2}
        \item <1> \textcolor{blue}{Analyzing the effect of different group formation on collaboration\\}
        {\small \textcolor{purple}{How different group formation based on their similarity of knowledge may influence collaborative learning effectiveness?} This investigation is needed to unveil the role of RKB for collaboration \& to determine the appropriate group setting} 
        \item <2> \textcolor{blue}{Predicting group outcomes based on individual maps\\}
        {\small \textcolor{purple}{How to foresee students' learning achievements as a group based on the maps created during individual phases (i.e. the initial and re-constructional maps)}?
