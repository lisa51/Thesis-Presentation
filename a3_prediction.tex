\begin{frame}{Motivation}

\begin{itemize}
    \item A preliminary study on RKB for collaborative learning has explained \textcolor{blue}{how the approach affects collaborative learning outcomes and students’ learning experiences \cite{Sadita2018PreliminaryLearning}}; however, it does not investigate how similarity of prior knowledge convergence and comprehension of partner's representation (\textcolor{blue}{during individual phase}) may potentially influence the final collaborative product.
    \item Identifying the relationship between the individual and group product is important since there is interdependence between these two. 
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Similarity of prior knowledge ($S(A, B)$)}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Adopted from the formula used by Ifenthaler \cite{Ifenthaler2010RelationalMaps,Lin1998AnSimilarity}.
    \item A similarity between objects \textit{A} and \textit{B} is related to \textcolor{blue}{their commonality and the differences} between them.
    
    {\footnotesize \item A graph \textit{G} = (\textit{V}, \textit{E}) is a finite set $V$ of $n$ nodes and a set \textit{E} of edges, where \textit{E} is a subset of $V \times V$. Given two undirected and labeled graphs, $A = (V, E_A)$ and $B = (V, E_B)$. \\
    \begin{equation}
      SE_{AB} = E_A \cap E_B 
    \end{equation}
    
    \begin{equation}
      UE_{AB} = E_A \ominus E_B 
    \end{equation}
    
    \begin{equation}
      S(A, B) = \frac{|SE_{AB}|}{{|SE_{AB}| + \frac{|UE_{AB}|}{2}}} 
    \end{equation}}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Comprehension of partner's representation ($C(A, B)$)}
\begin{itemize}
    \item It represents how an individual can reconstruct the partner's map components.
    {\small \item A graph $G_A = (V, E_A)$ is a finite set $V$ of $n$ nodes and a set $E$ of edges built by student $A$. A graph $R_A = (V, E_{RA})$ is a graph re-constructed by student $A$'s partner. 
    \begin{equation}
        E_{MA} = E_{RA} \cap E_A 
    \end{equation}
    \begin{equation}
        E_{NA} = E_{RA} \ominus E_A
    \end{equation}
    \item Given two undirected and labeled re-constructional graphs $R_A$ and $R_B$ with common node set $V$, 
    \begin{equation}
        C(A, B) = \frac{|E_{MA} + E_{MB}|}{|E_{MA} + E_{MB}| + \frac{|E_{NA} + E_{NB}|}{2}} 
    \end{equation}}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Linking word similarity}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item To uncover semantic similarity between two maps (ind. -- ind. maps / ind. -- group maps)
        
        \item Process:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item applying some pre-processing techniques (stemming, normalization, stop-word removal)
            \item utilizing \textcolor{blue}{Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) cosine similarity} formula to get the linking-word similarity value
            \item categorizing the sim value based on the Q1 \& Q3 of the score distribution
        \end{itemize}
        \item However,  this  measurement only covers common map elements that were defined by the students, such as the shared links
        
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Map score change}

To measure the change of map score from the individual to the collaborative phase, this 
study adopts the normalized change formula proposed by Marx and Cummings \cite{Marx2007NormalizedChange}.

\begin{equation}
 c =
    \begin{cases}
        \frac{gms - ais}{100 - ais} & \text{if $gms$ > $ais$}\\
        $drop$ & \text{if $gms$ = $ais$ = 100 or 0} \\
        0 & \text{if $gms$ = $ais$}\\
        \frac{gms - ais}{ais} & \text{if $gms$ < $ais$}
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}
